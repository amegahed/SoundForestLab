<div class="content">
	<p><%= application.name %> offers the ability to share files by invitation.  Sharing files by invitation allows you to share files privately and securely.  The invitation mechanism allows you to choose which files to share and to designate precisely who to share them with. </p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<h2><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i>Sending a Share Invitation</h2>
			<p>To share items by invitation, select the files or folders that you would like to share and then click "Share by Invitation" on the Share menu. </p>

				<div class="caption">"Share by Invitation" on the Share Menu</div>
			</div>

			<p>This will bring up the "Share with Connections" dialog where you can select the friends that you would like to share the selected files with. </p>

			</div>

			<p>Last, select how you would like to share these items - as a copy or as a clone. </p>

			<ul>
				<li><label>Copy</label> - when sharing a file as a copy, the original file is duplicated when the share is accepted, resulting in two identical separate copies, one belonging to the sender and one belonging to the receiver. </li>
				<li><label>Reference</label> - when sharing a file or folder as an original, the original item is referenced when the share is accepted, resulting in a single file or folder that is shared by the sender and the receiver. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h2><i class="fa fa-envelope-open"></i>Receiving a Share Invitation</h2>
			<p>If you have been sent an invitation to share a file or folder, then a file sharing notification will appear in your notifications list. </p>

				<div class="caption">A File Sharing Notification</div>
			</div>

			<p>You can choose to either accept (+) or decline (-) the shared file or folder.  If you accept the invitation, then you will be prompted to specific a file name and location to save the shared file or folder. </p>

			<div class="figure">
				<a href="images/help/sharing-files/sharing-by-invitation/save-file-dialog.png" target="_blank" class="lightbox" title="Save File Dialog"><img class="dialog" src="images/help/sharing-files/sharing-by-invitation/save-file-dialog.png" /></a>
				<div class="caption">Save File Dialog</div>
			</div>

			<p>If the file is shared with you as a clone rather than a copy, then the file or folder will display an icon or thumbnail of the file or folder's owner. If you mouse over the icon, you will see a tooltip showing the name of the item's owner. </p>
