<div class="content">
	<p><%= application.name %> offers a number of different ways for you to share files in order to provide the most effective ways for you to share data.  This section describes the available mechanisms for sharing data both with your <%= application.name %> connections and also with others who do not have <%= application.name %> accounts.  </p>

	<ol> 
		<li>
			<h2><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-user-friends icon"></i></span>Sharing Files with Connections</h2>
			<p>First, let's examine the ways that you can share files with your connections - i.e. people who have accounts and have accepted your connection request or who have sent you a connection request that you have accepted. </p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3><i class="fa fa-envelope icon"></i>Share by Invitation</h3>
					<p>When you <a href="#help/sharing-files/sharing-by-invitation">share files by invitation</a>, you are sending a file, or a reference to a file, to a particular connection.  This mechanism is particularly effective for collaboration because you can create shared files or folders that enable you and your connection(s) to access the same files. This way, you will both see changes made by the other.  It also saves space because there don't need to be multiple copies of each file. So, if you share files with a connection, these files are not counted against your connection's <a href="#help/managing-account/viewing-account">disk quota</a>. </p>

					<h3><i class="fa fa-newspaper icon"></i>Share by News Post</h3>
					<p>Another way to share files with your connections is to use the <a href="#apps/topic-viewer">News Browser</a> app to <a href="#help/sharing-files/sharing-by-post">share files and folders as attachments</a> to posts. </p>

			<h2><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-user icon"></i></span>Sharing Files with Anyone</h2>
			<p>Next, let's examine the ways that we can share files with anyone.  By "anyone", we mean the ability to share files with any specific person, whether or not they have an account or are connected to you. </p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3><i class="fa fa-link icon"></i>Share by Link</h3>
					<p>We can <a href="#help/sharing-files/sharing-by-link">share files and folders by creating a link</a> which can be emailed to another person or posted where another person can click on it to access the file or folder. </p>

					<div class="figure">
						<a href="images/help/sharing-files/sharing-by-link/copy-link-dialog.png" target="_blank" class="lightbox" title="Share File by Link"><img class="dialog" src="images/help/sharing-files/sharing-by-link/copy-link-dialog.png" /></a>
						<div class="caption">Share File by Link</div>
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3><i class="fa fa-envelope icon"></i>Share by Email</h3>
					<p>If you would like to send a file or folder to a specific person and you know that person's email address, then you can <a href="#help/sharing-files/sharing-by-email">send the file or folder by email</a>. </p>

					<div class="figure">
						<a href="images/help/sharing-files/sharing-by-email/share-by-email-dialog.png" target="_blank" class="lightbox" title="Share Folder by Email"><img class="dialog" src="images/help/sharing-files/sharing-by-email/share-by-email-dialog.png" /></a>

			<h2><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-globe icon"></i></span>Sharing Files with Everyone</h2>
			<p>Last, let's look at the mechanism for sharing files with everone.  By "everyone", we mean not limiting access to any specific person, but potenially making your files publicly available to anyone at all who might happen across your web page. </p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3><i class="fa fa-newspaper icon"></i>Share by Public Post</h3>
					<p>If you would like to share a file or folder with everyone, rather than a specific person, then you can use the <a href="#apps/topic-viewer">News Browser</a> app to <a href="#help/sharing-files/sharing-by-post">post it to the News section</a> of <a href="#help/creating-profile/viewing-home-page">your public home page.</a>. </p>

				</li>
			</ol>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3><i class="fa fa-newspaper icon"></i>Share by Public Home Page</h3>
					<p>When you registered for an account, you have also implicitly created a public home page that can be used for sharing files, folders, and photos. By putting files in your Public directory, you are automatically making them available to the public via <a href="#help/sharing-files/sharing-by-home-page">the Files and Photos tabs of your public home page.</a></p>

					<div class="figure">
						<a href="images/help/sharing-files/sharing-by-home-page/public-photos.png" target="_blank" class="lightbox" title="Share Photos by Public Home Page"><img src="images/help/sharing-files/sharing-by-home-page/public-photos.png" /></a>
