	<p>In order to to share, organize, or view files, you must first upload them to your <%= application.name %> account. There are two ways to upload files: (1) drag and drop and (2) using the File menu.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<h2><i class="fa fa-hand-grab"></i>Drag and Drop Uploading</h2>
			<p>The quickest and easiest way to upload files to your <%= application.name %> account is through drag and drop.  Simply drag files or folders from your operating system's Desktop and drop them onto your <%= application.name %> <a href="#help/getting-started/using-desktop">Desktop</a> or to a <a href="#apps/file-browser">File Browser</a> window.</p>

			<h2><i class="fa fa-upload"></i>Uploading from the File Menu</h2>
			<p>You can also upload files by using the File menu, either from your <%= application.name %> <a href="#help/getting-started/using-desktop">Desktop</a> or from a <a href="#apps/file-browser">File Browser</a> window. First, click "Upload" on the File menu. Your web browser will then open a file selection dialog that you can use to select files from your local file system to upload.</p>

				<h3><span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb"></i></span>Tip</h3><p>You can quickly upload files using the keyboard shortcut: command or control + U.</p>

			<h2><i class="fa fa-file"></i>Uploading Large Collections of Files</h2>
			<p>If you need to upload a large collection of several hundred files or more, it is much more efficient to compress this collection of files into a single large file (.zip or .tar) and to upload that than it is to upload many small files individually. If you try to upload a folder containing more than 500 files, you will be presented with a confirm dialog asking if you want to compress them first. </p>

				<div class="caption">Confirm Upload Dialog</div>
			</div>

			<p>If you upload a collection of files as a compresssed archive (.zip or .tar), you can <a href="#help/working-with-files/compressing-files">uncompress / expand</a> the archive simply by double-clicking on the uploaded archive file. </p>
