	<h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
	<p>Why is it important to control your own data and software?  Why not just use the software and web services that are available from the tech giants? </p>  

	<p>The tools offered by the tech giants are convenient, they are often free, and they have billions of dollars of development resources behind them.  Why should you bother considering anything else?  If they get the job done, why should you even care?</p>

				<h2>Personal Reasons To Care: </h2>
				<ol>
					<li>You want to have more choice in the software and web services that are available to you rather than just being satisfied with a handful of choices from the tech giants. </li>

					<li>You are concerned about the privacy and control of your own data and don't like the idea of being exploited for survelliance capitalism. </li>

					<li>You care about the ability to control and archive your data long into the future, regardless of corporate or policy changes that are outside of your control. </li>

					<li>You would like the option of being able to customize and tailor your personal tech to fit your individual needs or style instead of just using a one size fits all solution. </li>

					<li>You are a tech worker and you would like the option of being able to work for smaller, local employers rather than just a few large mega-corporations. </li>

				<h2>Societal Reasons To Care: </h2>
				<ol>
					<li>You are concerned about the effects of monopoly power and the corruption and anti-competitive behavior that occurs when too much power is controlled by a small number of people or companies. </li>

					<li>You are against the current lottery based economy where all economic rewards go to a small number of winners. </li>

					<li>You care about the falling rate of entrepreneurship and the ability for innovative people to start new companies with a chance at survival. </li>

					<li>You are concerned about the prospects of the population's data being funnelled through a small number of easily monitored and controlled data silos. </li>

					<li>You care about the pace of innovation in science and technology which has been declining steadily over the past few decades (The "Great Stagnation"). </li>

		<p>If you care about any of these issues, then you should seriously consider looking into ways to opt out of the current tech giant controlled software and web services ecosystem. Fortunately, there are alternative options avaiable that are comparable and in many ways superior to than the solutions that everyone else uses.  It may take more effort to seek out these alternatives, but doing so provides benefits to you personally and also benefits to the world and community in which you live. </p>

		Today we face another software crisis, but it’s one we don’t talk about much. Only the largest, richest firms can afford to create connected applications. There is a cloud, but it’s proprietary. Our data and our knowledge is disappearing from our personal computers into clouds that we cannot access and with which we cannot compete. Who owns our social networks? It is like the mainframe-PC revolution in reverse.
