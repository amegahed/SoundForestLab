<div class="content">
	<p>The user data policy describes how we manage all data that you have entered or uploaded to the platform. </p>

	<h2><i class="fa fa-copyright"></i>Data Ownership</h2>
	<p>The service assumes no ownership of any user data. </p>

	<div class="attention"><div class="emphasis">You retain all ownership to your data. </div></div>

	<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>You Retain All Ownership</h3>
	<p>You retain all rights to any files, images, or other data that you have entered or uploaded to the service. </p>

	<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>We Assume No Ownership</h3>
	<p>We do not assume any rights to any file, images, or other data that you have entered or uploaded to the service.  Therefore, we will never share, distribute, or sell any of your data to any third party without prior consent. </p>

	<div class="attention"><div class="emphasis">We will never share, distribute, or sell any of your data. </div></div>

	<h2><i class="fa fa-eye"></i>Data Transparency</h2>
	<p>Using the platform, you, as a normal user, have visibility, access and control over your data.  The data that you see in the user interface is the data that the system has in storage. Unlike other platforms, there is no hidden user data. </p>

	<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Hidden File System</h3>
	<p>Every file that you upload to the platform is visible to you as a normal user using the <a href="#apps/file-browser">File Browser</a> app within the platform.  There are no hidden files and there is no shadow file system.  If you upload and post an item such as an image, video, or audio file as part of a news post or a direct message, then will be added to your personal file system where you can see and control it, not hidden away in a shadow file system that you do not have access to.  If you can see a file belonging to you in the user interface, then you can delete it using the file browser app.  If you can't see the file using the file browser app, then it does not exist. </p>

	<div class="attention"><div class="emphasis">There are no hidden user files. </div></div>

	<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Soft Database Deletes</h3>
	<p>The platform does not soft delete database entries.  If you delete an item such as a news post or a direct message, it will be permanantly deleted from the database.  There is no soft deleting where items appear to be deleted to the user but continue to exist hidden in a hidden state within the database.  If you see an item in the user interface, then you can delete it.  If you do not see the item, then it does not exist. </p>

	<div class="attention"><div class="emphasis">If you delete an item, it will be deleted from the database. </div></div>

	<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Hidden User Accounts</h3>
	<p>When you delete your user account, all of the files and database entries associated with that account will also be deleted.  If you delete your account, then it will be as if you had never logged in. </p>

	<h2><i class="fa fa-trash-alt"></i>Deletion of Data</h2>
	<p>You may delete all files and database information associated with your account at any time by deleting your account as described here: <a href="#help/managing-account/deleting-account">Deleting Your Account</a></p>
