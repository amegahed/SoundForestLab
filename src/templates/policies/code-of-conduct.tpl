<div class="content">
	<p>These guidelines cover expections for user conduct when using the social functions such as social networking and chat. The social platform is potentially visible to a wide audience, so it's expected that you behave accordingly. </p>

	<h2><i class="fa fa-smile"></i>Encouraged Behavior</h2>
	<p>The following are considered to be positive, encouraged behavior.</p>

	<div class="group">
		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Be Courteous</h3>
		<p>Just like your mom should have told you when you were a kid - be nice. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Be Thoughtful</h3>
		<p>It's not always easy, but keep heated discussions civil.  A courteous argument is actual more persuasive than a mean spirited one. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Be Brief</h3>
		<p>Being brief and on-topic is part of being courteous. Nobody likes reading long winded TLDR posts. If you simply must post a manifesto, then post it as an attached document rather than inline text. </p>
	</div>

	<h2><i class="fa fa-frown"></i>Discouraged Behavior</h2>
	<p>The following are discouraged or prohibited behavior.  Failure to comply with these terms may result in the suspension or loss of your account. </p>

	<div class="group">
		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Advertising</h3>
		<p>Whether it's shamelessly promoting yourself or your company, don't do it.  It's ok to post an opinion about a commerical product but no commercial promotion will be tolerated. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Spam</h3>
		<p>No other forms of excessive self-promotion will be tolerated. Nobody wants to hear about how you can make $100k / yr in your pajamas or other scams. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Trolling</h3>
		<p>Trolling is another one of those things that's hard to define but you know it when you see it.  Don't be a troll.  It may be fun at the moment, but nobody likes a troll. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Illegal Activities</h3>
		<p>Don't post illegal, prohibited or copyrighted content. If it's not yours, don't post it.  If it involves illegal activities, don't post it. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Nudity</h3>
		<p>Keep it clean.  If it's not something that you'd be ok viewing at work or showing to your mom, then you shouldn't post it here. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Doxxing</h3>
		<p>No posting other people's private personal contact, phone, or location / geographic information, unless you have ok'ed it with the person beforehand. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Ranting</h3>
		<p>If you're writing your posts in ALL CAPS, then you're probably ranting (or exceedingly old or both).  Chill. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Profanity</h3>
		<p>Watch your language. Excessive @#$%& language drags down the level of discussion and won't be tolerated. </p>

		<h3><i class="fa fa-check"></i>No Misinformation</h3>
		<p>Intentional spreading of misinformation for purposes of promoting political viewpoints, conspiracy theories, or other forms of ideological promotion won't be tolerated. </p>
